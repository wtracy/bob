BOB -- Beep On Battery

Bob is an acpiclient replacement written in Python. It monitors the power left in your laptop battery, and whether your laptop is plugged in or not.

If you run Bob normally with no arguments on a system with a Linux kernel exporting the /sys/class interface (older kernels using the /proc/acpi inteface are unsupported) you will see output that is mostly compatible with acpiclient.

Bob also has the ability to run as a CGI program. It will automatically detect that the presence of CGI environment variables, and produce HTML output.

The code currently checked in is the result of one afternoon's hacking, so it's still a bit rough, but it works. I want to add support to run in the system icon tray; I'm still debating whether to do this via PyGTK or wxPython.
