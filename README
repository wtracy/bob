BOB -- Beep On Battery

This software package actually contains three components: a Python library for accessing ACPI (acpi.py); Acpy, a Python replacement for Acpiclient; and Bob, a GTk+ app that runs in your system tray and displays your battery status.

The underlying acpi library assumes a Linux kernel exporting the /sys/class interface; older kernels using the /proc/acpi interface are unsupported. BSD support is on the to-do list.

Acpy also has the ability to run as a CGI program. It will automatically detect that it is running as a CGI program via the presence of CGI environment variables, and produce HTML output.

Bob, the graphical component, is still very much under development. In particular, be aware that activating the 'alert' feature may cause crashes.
