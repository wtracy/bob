BOB -- Beep On Battery

Bob is an acpiclient replacement written in Python. It monitors the power left in your laptop battery, and whether your laptop is plugged in or not.

If you run Bob normally with no arguments on a system with a Linux kernel exporting the /sys/class interface (older kernels using the /proc/acpi inteface are unsupported) you will see output that is mostly compatible with acpiclient.

Bob also has the ability to run as a CGI program. It will automatically detect that it is running as a CGI program via the presence of CGI environment variables, and produce HTML output.

I am working on support for running in the system tray via GTk+. This code is very much a work in progress. To activate it, run Bob with the -x argument.
